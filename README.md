# Hello Drinkbot! 

Cocktail robotics is a fascinating hobby and obsession. 
[Roboexotica](http://roboexotica.at/) was the first, 'and , inevitably, the 
leading festival concerned with cocktail robotics world-wide.'

But you don't have to go to Vienna to make cocktail robots!

Cocktail robotics has traditionally had a fairly steep learning cliff.
There are so many different skills which one can excercise in order to 
create an entertaining robot! 

The Hello Drinkbot project seeks to create a 'hello world' of drinkbots 
to lower the learning cliff so that more people can have fun creating
entertaining ways to get their friends drunk.

The goal is that a person can use the plans here to assemble a functional
drink dispensing robot in an hour or two. You can then build on that 
'hello world' drinkbot in different ways...

Note: not all cocktail robots make drinks, and there are many paths
to cocktail robotics greatness! The premise of Hello Drinkbot is that
having a simple way to make cocktails will bring more people in to apply
their skills and talents and genius to the goal of entertaining us all.

And...cocktail robotics has a history of triggering interesting innovations
in unexpected areas...so dig in! Make a robot. It is fun. And perhaps, a little
messy!
