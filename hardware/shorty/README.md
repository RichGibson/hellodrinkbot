# Shorty


![Hello Drinkbot: 'Shorty'](shorty.png "Shorty")

A variant of the Stand alone version, but without the legs. 

Laser cut from 6 mm (1/4") material. Use 4 M3-12mm screws and nuts to fasten 
the case together.

This is a basic box with openings cut for four peristaltic pumps, mounting
holes for a Raspberry Pi.

This needs to be placed on a shelf, or other support, or mounted to something 
in order to have it above the supply bottles. There is a piece which holds the 
dispensing tubes in place, and it dispenses out the bottom.
