# RPiPitch

https://github.com/katrinamo/RPiPitch

This directory contains the code for a Raspberry Pi guitar tuner based on an FFT pitch detection algorithm. The code that should be executed is the freqDetect.py file. To execute, run `python freqDetect.py` in a linux terminal.

The original frequency detection algorithm can be found here https://benchodroff.com/2017/02/18/using-a-raspberry-pi-with-a-microphone-to-hear-an-audio-alarm-using-fft-in-python/

This project modifies the fft algorthm, but it's based on the source found above.
