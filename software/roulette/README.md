# Ukrainian Roulette

Strip out the need for Bartendro. We have four pumps, we don't need all 
of that code. Especially since I don't understand it.

New buttons are installed, and work. And I modified Bartendro a bit. And 
now if you press button 2 and then button 1 it is fine, but if you 
go the other way bartendro stops the second pump when the first one
finishes dispensing.

Also, the case is beautiful. The Burroughs-Apple montage is amazing.

And I now understand why Christine liked the name. It is not 'yay
Ukraine' it is 'we hate Russia, so it is like Freedom Fries' or 
'Victory Cabbage.'  Just reflexive erasure of the enemy and disfavored

Based on an idea of Spencer's at the 'Drinkbot Hackathon and Networking'
event May 12th, 2018

A bot appears. There are two buttons on the top. One labeled with
one figure, the other with two figures.

One or two people put shot glasses under the robot, in the dispensing
area. And then a button is pushed.

One or two shots are poured. Probably 1/2 oz shots.

And the participants drink.

Most of the shots are as expected. But one out of six is something less
attractive. Right now we are thinking Malort.

That's it...

## Hardware

Four pumps, thinking a custom box, two buttons, Raspberry Pi and motor
hat.

## Software

Running Hello Drinkbot image, but a custom bit of python.



## Decoration

Thinking of a picture of William Burroughs with an apple on his head on
the front. If you know, you know. I printed an assortment of pictures, and of
apples at various sizes, and Christine ran with it. Yay.

The top is painted with Ukranian colors.  Christine explained that this was funny
in the same way that 'Freedom Fries' are funny. We have a geopolitical bruhaha (disregarding
the legitimacy of the tiff) and we need to rename things that originate in the 'other'
nation.

Freedom Fries. Liberty cabbage in place of saurkraut. etc.
