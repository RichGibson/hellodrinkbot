# Ukrainian Roulette

Aug 6, 2022
Based on an idea of Spencer's at the 'Drinkbot Hackathon and Networking'
event May 12th, 2018

A bot appears. There are two buttons on the top. One labeled with
one figure, the other with two figures.

One or two people put shot glasses under the robot, in the dispensing
area. And then a button is pushed.

One or two shots are poured. Probably 1/2 oz shots.

And the participants drink.

Most of the shots are as expected. But one out of six is something less
attractive. Right now we are thinking Malort.

That's it...

## Hardware

Four pumps, thinking a custom box, two buttons, Raspberry Pi and motor
hat.

## Software

Running Hello Drinkbot image, but a custom bit of python.



## Decoration

Thinking of a picture of William Burroughs with an apple on his head on
the front. If you know, you know.

Painted with Ukranian colors on the parts without the picture.
