Did brain surgery, Ukranian Roulette gets the old pi. Bender has a 3b,
and a motor hat with header pins soldered on for the buttons and led's.

And booted up into bender.py, a copy of ukr.py, and the buttons blink back 
and forth just as they should.



## Sept 5th, 2022

Soldered a hat for an old raspberry pi, and buttons and connected
pumps and it all worked using the ukr.py code. So, copy that code
and reconfigure it to be Martini or fuck you.

## Hardware

Two pumps, two buttons, Raspberry Pi and motor hat. Amazing body of
Bender made by Christine.


## Software

Just pouring from one bottle - premixed martinis, so just use my
own code, no Bartendro
